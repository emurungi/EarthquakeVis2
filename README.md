# EarthquakeVis
Repository For Small Data Visualisation Project - Earthquake Visualisation for a visualisation project from a previous class.

## Summary of Visualisation Project

Earthquakes have an indelible impact on individuals, communities, and societies. The catastrophic consequences of seismic events are vividly exemplified by the earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010, with a magnitude of 7.0. This devastating quake not only caused widespread destruction of infrastructure but also claimed the lives of over 230,000 people, displacing more than 1.5 million residents.

The unfortunate reality is that earthquakes are inherently difficult to predict. However, the wealth of available data on seismic activities enables the identification of trends and the drawing of conclusions with a high degree of certainty. Despite the unpredictable nature of earthquakes, our motivation behind this project is to explore where they occur most frequently, both geographically and in populous cities, as well as identifying patterns related to their occurrence over time.

*   The content of this project is displayed on a [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) website which allows us to host rendered HTML files directly from this repository.
    * The website is displayed at the link [https://emurungi.github.io/EarthquakeVis](https://emurungi.github.io/EarthquakeVis/)
    
* To edit the R code as well as convert the Rmd to HTML, I use R Studio as a code editor and also both VS Code and the Terminal to interact with Git
